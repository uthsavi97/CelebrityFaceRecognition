## Sports Celebrity Image Classification: A Machine Learning-Powered Personal Project

This project explores the application of machine learning to automate the identification of my five favorite sports personalities from their images. Beyond personal gratification, it serves as a practical training ground for key data science and machine learning skills, culminating in a deployed web application.

**Technical Focus:**

* **Project Workflow:** The project adheres to a rigorous machine learning project lifecycle, encompassing data collection, cleaning and pre-processing, feature engineering, model building, optimization, deployment, and evaluation.
* **Facial Recognition and Feature Engineering:** OpenCV library assists in facial and eye detection for image pre-processing, while wavelet transforms provide robust feature extraction for model training.
* **Model Exploration and Comparison:** Three diverse classification models - SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest - are implemented and compared for optimal performance.
* **Hyperparameter Optimization:** GridSearchCV automates hyperparameter tuning, ensuring the model reaches its full potential.
* **Web Application Development:** Python Flask builds the back-end server, while HTML, CSS, and JavaScript craft a user-friendly interface for image upload and real-time classification results.
